**Technologies Used**

**Organizational/Communication Tools Used**

On day one our group decided to spend some time and research tools to help our team's overall communication and organization. We found that Trello would be the best fit for dividing up tasks and tracking our progress. We also decided that holding 15-30 min stand meetings at the start of each day to go over what we have accomplished, what needs to be done, and who is doing what, would be the best way to have everyone up to speed on our app. Lastly, we stayed active on Slack for any questions or suggestions we had for eachother.

**User Stories**

* User is initially brought to the Home page where they can view a carousel of latest products as well as a link to Shop, a navigation bar that includes links for 'Home', 'Shop', 'About', 'Contact Us', as well as user login and and signup options.
* User is able to acess all visible links in navigation bar without being authenticated. They may also view individual item's show pages.
* When the user visits the Shop page they can see all items for sale, with information on each item that includes the name, price, and a short description of the item.
* When a user clicks "Add to Cart" the selceted item will be added to the cart which is visible by clicking on the Cart link in the top right corner of the page.
* When the user is veiwing their items in the cart, they are able to remove unwanted items from cart.
* If a user is authenticated as an admin they will have access to edit, delete and create new items on the Shop page.


**Struggles**

We planned to have a filter component that would allow users to filter the products that are displayed based on color, name, price etc. However we could not get the filters to work properly and decided as a team to leave it out and come back to later in the course.

**Notes for Adding to the Project Later**

* Incoporate filters for user to use on Shop page.
* Add top three relevent items below selected item on show page.
* Ability for user to edit quantity of items in shopping cart.
* Adjust styling for mobile use.
